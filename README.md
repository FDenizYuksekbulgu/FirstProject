                                                                                     FIRST PROJECT'S DETAILS


------------------- GUESS NUMBER --------------------------

SUMMARY:

In this program, the computer determines a random number between 1 and 100.

Then the user is asked to guess this number.

Each time the user guesses, the computer checks whether it is close to the number it has chosen and gives a clue as higher or lower.

The user has 5 guesses. After each guess, the remaining number is shown.

If the user guesses correctly, he is congratulated and the game is over.

If the 5 guesses are over, the correct number is shown and the game is over.

THE TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED:

c# language was used at a basic level in this program.


---------------------- CALCULATOR --------------------------

SUMMARY:

The user is asked to enter the first number.

The user is asked to enter the second number.

The user is asked to select the operation they want to perform.

for addition
for subtraction
for multiplication
/ for division

The appropriate operation is performed according to the user's selection and the result is printed on the screen. If the division operation is selected, the division by zero error condition is checked.

The calculator is only sensitive to integers.

THE TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED:

A simple calculator was created using the C# programming language while writing the program.

Methods such as Console.ReadLine() and Convert.ToInt32() were used to correctly receive user input.

The switch-case structure was used in the selection of operations.

When performing the division operation, the division by zero error was checked and an appropriate message was displayed to the user.

------------------------------------------- AVERAGE CALCULATION -------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY:

#This program calculates the average exam score and converts the result into a letter score. #Gets the grades of three courses from the user. #Checks if the grades are valid (must be between 0 and 100). #Calculates the average after getting the valid grades. #Determines the letter grade with the average value and prints it on the screen.

THE TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED:

C# Programming Language,

.NET Framework / .NET Core,

Console Application,

if-else block.
